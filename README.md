# What is SysFlow?

The SysFlow Telemetry Pipeline is a framework for monitoring cloud workloads and for creating performance and security analytics. The goal of this project is to build all the plumbing required for system telemetry so that users can focus on writing and sharing analytics on a scalable, common open-source platform. The backbone of the telemetry pipeline is a new data format called SysFlow, which lifts raw system event information into an abstraction that describes process behaviors, and their relationships with containers, files, and network. This object-relational format is highly compact, yet it provides broad visibility into container clouds. We have also built several APIs that allow users to process SysFlow with their favorite toolkits. Learn more about SysFlow in the [SysFlow specification document](https://sysflow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/spec.html).

# About This Image

This image packages SysFlow Exporter, which exports SysFlow traces to S3-compliant object stores or rsyslog servers in several formats, including Avro, JSON, and CSV. Please check [sf-exporter usage](https://sysflow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/exporter.html#usage) for complete set of options.

# How to use this image

The easiest way to run the SysFlow exporter is from a Docker container, with host mount for the trace files to export. The following command shows how to run sf-exporter with trace files located in `/mnt/data` on the host.

```
docker run -d --rm --name sf-exporter \
    -e S3_ENDPOINT=<ip_address> \
    -e S3_BUCKET=<bucket_name> \
    -e S3_ACCESS_KEY=<access_key> \
    -e S3_SECRET_KEY=<secret_key> \
    -e NODE_IP=$HOSTNAME \
    -e INTERVAL=150 \ 
    -v /mnt/data:/mnt/data \
    sysflowtelemetry/sf-exporter
```

It's also possible to read S3's keys as docker secrets `s3_access_key` and `s3_secret_key`. Remote syslog export is also supported. Instructions for `docker compose` and `helm` deployments are available in [here](https://sysflow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/deploy.html).
